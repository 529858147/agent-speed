# Agent Speed — Design Specification

The product should feel like a precision racing instrument that comes alive as your agents speed up. Calm and
quiet when idle, electric when cruising, and on fire at the redline. Every effect must be driven by real data, stay
smooth (60 fps, no dropped frames), and never cost noticeable CPU when idle.

Both platforms share this language. Platform idioms win for chrome (menus, settings controls, window behaviour);
this document wins for the orb, the bar widget and all speed visuals.

## 0. Appearance and language

- **Appearance** setting: Auto (default, follows the system and switches live), Light, Dark. It applies to every
  surface: orb, dashboard, settings, and the bar widget text. On Windows, Auto follows the app theme
  (`AppsUseLightTheme`) for windows and the taskbar theme (`SystemUsesLightTheme`) for the taskbar widget.
- **Language** setting: System (default), 繁體中文, 简体中文, English, 日本語. Switching applies live, no restart.
  Fallback: zh-HK/zh-MO/zh-TW → zh-Hant, other zh → zh-Hans, ja → ja, everything else → en.

## 1. Speed → heat

`R` = redline speed of the selected metric. Output speed (default metric): setting default **400 tok/s**, range
100–2000, step 50. Total throughput (includes cached input, typically ~1000× larger): its own setting, default
**200k tok/s**, range 20k–2M. The redline slider edits the value of the current metric. `v` = live value of the
selected metric.

- Heat `h = min(1, (v / R) ^ 0.6)`.
- Overdrive `o = clamp((v - R) / R, 0, 1)` — extra intensity beyond the redline.
- Both are smoothed with a critically damped spring (settle ≈ 0.6 s) before driving visuals.

### Tiers (hysteresis: a tier is entered at its threshold and left at 90 % of it; a tier must hold 0.8 s to be shown)

| Tier | zh-Hant | zh-Hans | English | 日本語 | Enter at |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| idle | 待機 | 待机 | IDLE | 待機 | `v < 0.5` for 3 s |
| cruise | 巡航 | 巡航 | CRUISE | 巡航 | `v ≥ 0.5` |
| boost | 加速 | 加速 | BOOST | 加速 | `v ≥ 0.15 R` |
| overdrive | 狂飆 | 狂飙 | OVERDRIVE | 爆速 | `v ≥ 0.375 R` |
| redline | 極限 | 极限 | REDLINE | 限界 | `v ≥ 0.75 R` |

### Heat palette (interpolate in OKLab or linear RGB between stops)

| h | Color | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.00 | `#7C8798` | slate, idle |
| 0.10 | `#2DD4BF` | teal |
| 0.30 | `#38BDF8` | sky |
| 0.48 | `#818CF8` | indigo |
| 0.64 | `#E879F9` | fuchsia |
| 0.78 | `#FB7185` | rose |
| 0.90 | `#FB923C` | orange |
| 1.00 | `#FACC15` | gold |

White-hot core for highlights: `#FFF7D6`. With overdrive `o > 0`, highlights blend toward the white-hot core by `o`.

### Source colors

| Source | Color |
| --- | --- |
| Codex | `#34D399` mint |
| Claude Code | `#FF8A65` coral |
| Claude Desktop | `#B39DFF` lilac |

## 2. The orb (floating window)

A circular smoked-glass instrument. Diameter `S` (setting 96–240 pt/DIP, default 148). The window is `1.5 S` square so
the aura and sparks can leave the disc; everything outside the disc is fully transparent and ignores clicks wherever
the platform allows it. The orb follows the Appearance setting. The dark variant is described inline below; the
light variant ("porcelain") changes only these tokens:

| Token | Dark | Light |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Body gradient | `#1B2030 → #090B10` at 88 % | `#FFFFFF → #E7EBF3` at 86 % |
| Blur material | macOS `.hudWindow` | macOS `.popover` (light) |
| Rim | white 14 % top → 0 % | white 95 % top highlight + 1 px outer stroke black 8 % |
| Drop shadow | black 45 %, y `0.03 S`, blur `0.10 S` | black 16 %, y `0.04 S`, blur `0.12 S` |
| Unlit segments | white 7 % | black 8 % |
| Value text | white 96 % | `#0B0D12` 92 % |
| Unit / secondary | white 55 % | black 50 % |
| Tier label | heat color | heat color darkened 18 % (OKLab L) for ≥ 3:1 contrast |
| Aura opacity | `0.55 * h`, additive | `0.32 * h`, normal blending |
| Sparks / embers | additive, heat → white-hot | normal blending, heat colors, size +20 %, white-hot replaced by `#FFB020` |
| Leading segment | white-hot `#FFF7D6` + bloom | heat color + bloom |

Layers, back to front:

1. **Aura** — radial gradient in the heat color around the disc, radius `0.5 S → 0.75 S`, opacity `0.55 * h`
   (0 at idle). Breathes: period 4 s at cruise → 0.7 s at redline, amplitude ±15 %. Flares on every response pulse.
2. **Body** — circle with a background blur of the desktop (macOS `NSVisualEffectView` `.hudWindow`; Windows: acrylic
   is not available for layered windows, use a solid gradient) overlaid with a vertical gradient `#1B2030 → #090B10`
   at 88 % (multiplied by the opacity setting). A 1 px inner stroke, white 14 % at the top fading to 0 % at the bottom
   (specular rim), and a soft inner shadow. A faint radial "lens" highlight at the top-left (white 6 %).
3. **Gauge** — 270° arc starting at 135° (bottom-left) going clockwise to 45° (bottom-right), gap at the bottom.
   Radius `0.41 S`, made of **36 LED segments**, each `0.045 S` long radially, with 2.2° gaps. Unlit segments:
   white 7 %. Lit count = `h * 36` (fractional: the last segment is partially lit by brightness). Each lit segment has
   the heat color *of its own position* (segment i uses `h_i = i / 35`), so the arc shows the spectrum as it fills.
   The leading segment is drawn white-hot with a bloom (blurred copy, radius `0.03 S`). Four tick dots just outside
   the arc mark the tier thresholds.
   Redline: lit segments shimmer (random brightness 75–100 %, 12 Hz) and the outer edge of the arc gets a pulsing
   glow.
4. **Comet** — a 40° gradient arc (transparent → heat color → white-hot head) travelling just outside the gauge,
   clockwise. Hidden at idle. Period: 6 s at cruise → 0.7 s at redline (interpolate by `h`). Opacity `0.25 + 0.6 h`.
5. **Sparks** (from boost upward, `h ≥ 0.45`) — emitted from the leading segment and randomly along the lit arc,
   flying outward with a tangential component in the comet direction. Lifetime 0.5–1.2 s, size 1.2–2.8 px, color from
   heat to white-hot, additive blending, slight drag. Emission rate `120/s * ((h - 0.45) / 0.55)`.
   **Embers** at redline: rising flame particles around the upper half of the ring with turbulence and gravity
   pointing up, rate `+90/s * max(o, 0.3)`.
6. **Readout** — centered.
   - Value: system font (SF Pro / Segoe UI Variable Display), weight bold, tabular digits, size `0.24 S`, white 96 %.
     Rolling digit transition on change. From boost upward the value gets a heat-colored glow (radius `0.035 S`).
     From overdrive upward the value leans forward: skew `-6° * h` (motion feel). At redline add a 0.6 px jitter
     (≤ 30 Hz) — disabled in "soft" effects and with Reduce Motion.
   - Unit `tok/s`: `0.072 S`, medium, white 55 %, tracking +0.5.
   - Tier label: `0.062 S`, semibold, uppercase for Latin, tracking +1.6, in the heat color, below the unit. A tier
     change slides the old label up/out and the new one up/in (0.35 s) and flashes the gauge (+25 % brightness, 0.4 s).
   - Agent dots: in the gauge gap at the bottom, one 4 px dot per generating agent colored by source (max 6, then
     `+n`), gently pulsing while generating.
7. **Pulse** — on each `responseCompleted`: a shockwave ring from `0.5 S` to `0.74 S`, stroke 2 px → 0, opacity
   0.6 → 0 over 0.7 s ease-out, color = heat of that response's speed. Strength (opacity/width) scales with
   `log10(output)`. Coalesce: at most one wave per 150 ms.
8. **New peak** — on `newPeak`: 24 gold rays burst from the disc edge, the gauge sweeps 0 → current in 0.5 s, and a
   pill label `新紀錄 NEW PEAK` (localized) springs in above the value for 1.8 s.

Idle state: value `0` in white 60 %, label `待機`, gauge dim, comet hidden, and every 6 s a slow light sweep runs
along the unlit segments as a sign of life. Optional "fade when idle" (setting): after 60 s idle, fade the window to
45 % opacity; restore instantly on activity or hover.

Hover: the orb scales to 1.03 (spring), the tier label crossfades to a compact info line
(`今日 1.2M · 3 個 agent`), and the cursor shows it is draggable.

Interaction:
- Drag anywhere on the disc to move. On release within 24 pt of a screen edge, snap to a 12 pt margin (spring).
  Position (center point, per display) persists.
- Double-click: open the dashboard.
- Right-click: context menu — Size (S / M / L presets 112 / 148 / 196), Effects (Off / Soft / Standard / Max),
  Always on top, Click-through, Hide floating orb, Settings…, Quit.
- Click-through mode: the orb ignores all mouse events; it is controlled from the menu bar / taskbar.

Effects intensity (setting, default Standard):

| Level | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Off | Static colors and segments only; no aura breathing, comet, particles, pulses, jitter or skew |
| Soft | Aura, comet and pulses; no particles, no jitter |
| Standard | Everything above, sparks, embers, skew; jitter only at redline |
| Max | Standard with 1.6× particle rates, stronger bloom, and a faint heat-distortion shimmer at redline |

System "Reduce Motion" caps the level at Soft and replaces movement with crossfades.

Performance: when idle and not hovered, render at ≤ 10 fps (or only on change). Particles use a fixed-size pool
(≤ 400). The renderer pauses entirely while the orb is hidden or fully occluded.

## 3. Menu bar (macOS) and taskbar (Windows) widget

Glanceable and calm; it must never jitter in width.

- Layout: `[gauge glyph] [value] [unit]`.
- Gauge glyph: 270° ring, 2 px stroke (scale with DPI), diameter = text cap height × 1.5 (16 pt in the menu bar),
  track at 25 % of the label color, fill fraction `h` in the heat color with a 6 px soft glow from overdrive upward.
  At redline the fill flickers gently (opacity 85–100 %, 6 Hz). Monochrome option uses the label color only.
- Value: system font, 13 pt (menu bar) / 15 px semibold (taskbar), tabular digits, placed tight against the glyph
  (4–5 pt gap, never more). The item hugs its content: its width grows immediately when the formatted value gets
  longer and shrinks only after the shorter width has held for 6 s, so with tabular digits it changes only when the
  digit count changes and never flickers. Idle value uses the secondary label color.
- Unit `tok/s`: 10 pt / 11 px, secondary color, optional (setting).
- Display modes (setting): glyph + value (default), value only, glyph only.
- Click: open/close the dashboard. Right-click (Windows) / ⌥-click (macOS): quick menu.
- The widget follows the system/taskbar light or dark theme for text; the glyph keeps heat colors.

## 4. Dashboard

macOS: popover-style panel under the menu bar item. Windows: flyout above the taskbar with Mica. Width 368 pt/DIP.
Follows system light/dark. Corner radius: platform default (macOS 12–16 pt, Windows 8 px). 20 pt padding.

Sections (top to bottom, 16 pt spacing, hairline separators):

1. **Hero** — a 112 pt orb (same component, effects capped at Soft) on the left; on the right the value at 44 pt bold
   tabular with `tok/s`, the tier label in heat color, and one line of context: `生成中 3 · 工具 1`.
2. **Live chart** — last 2 minutes (segmented control 1m / 2m / 5m), height 96. Smooth area chart (Catmull-Rom),
   fill = vertical gradient mapped through the heat palette by value, line 1.5 px. The in-flight estimated part is
   drawn with 45 % opacity and a dashed top line at the right edge. A dashed horizontal line marks today's peak with a
   small label. Hover/drag shows a crosshair with time and value.
3. **Sources** — one row per source: colored dot, name, live tok/s (right), today's output tokens (secondary).
   Unavailable sources are dimmed with `未偵測到` and a link to settings.
4. **Agents** — up to 6 rows sorted by section 6.7 of METRICS: project (semibold), source + model (secondary,
   truncated), phase badge (generating: animated three-dot shimmer in the source color; tools: wrench glyph;
   idle: grey dot), live tok/s right-aligned. Sub-agents are indented 12 pt with a thin connector line.
   Empty state: `目前沒有 agent 在工作` with a muted gauge glyph.
5. **Today** — 2×2 metric grid: 輸出, 輸入 (含快取), 請求, 平均速度; plus 今日峰值 with time.
6. **Footer** — floating orb toggle, metric info button (ⓘ explaining the measurement in one paragraph), settings,
   quit.

Metric explanation text (localized):
> 速度＝輸出 token ÷ 實際生成時間（從送出請求到完成，含等待第一個字）。多個 agent 會加總。進行中的回應先以該 agent
> 近期的實測速度估算，回應完成後立即以實測值校正。資料只來自本機紀錄。

## 5. Settings

Native settings window (macOS: SwiftUI `Settings`/grouped `Form`; Windows: Fluent WPF window with Mica). Sections:

- **一般 General** — Appearance (Auto / Light / Dark), Language (System / 繁體中文 / 简体中文 / English / 日本語),
  Launch at login, Speed metric
  (Output speed / Total throughput incl. input), Redline speed (slider 100–2000, step 50, shows the tier thresholds).
- **選單列 / 工作列 Menu bar / Taskbar** — Display mode, Colored glyph, Show unit.
- **懸浮窗 Floating orb** — Show, Size (slider + presets), Opacity (40–100 %), Always on top, Click-through,
  Fade when idle, Show on all Spaces (macOS).
- **特效 Effects** — Intensity (Off / Soft / Standard / Max), Celebrate new peaks, Response pulses,
  **Preview effects** button: runs the demo driver for 20 s sweeping through every tier.
- **資料來源 Data sources** — per source: toggle, detected path, status (`找到 128 個工作階段` / `未找到資料夾`),
  Change…, Reset.
- **關於 About** — version, GitHub link, license, privacy statement: read-only, local-only, no network, no telemetry,
  conversation content is never stored or displayed.

All settings apply live without restart and persist immediately.

## 6. Typography & spacing

- macOS: system font (SF Pro; PingFang TC/SC and Hiragino Sans chosen automatically). Windows: `Segoe UI Variable`
  (fallback `Segoe UI`) with `Microsoft JhengHei UI` (zh-Hant) / `Microsoft YaHei UI` (zh-Hans) / `Yu Gothic UI` (ja).
- Numbers: always tabular digits.
- Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32.
- Animations: springs (response 0.45 s, damping 0.82) for layout; 0.2 s ease-out for color and opacity.

## 7. Accessibility

- Every interactive element is reachable by keyboard and has an accessible label.
- The orb exposes its value as an accessibility element (`每秒 128 個 token，加速`), updated at most once per second.
- Respect Reduce Motion, Reduce Transparency (solid body instead of blur), Increase Contrast (stronger strokes),
  and high-contrast themes on Windows.
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for all secondary text.

## 8. Localization

Languages: zh-Hant (primary), zh-Hans, en, ja. Follow the system language unless overridden in settings (section 0).
All shared strings live in `spec/strings.json`; each platform embeds that table (copied at build time or as a
resource) and keeps platform-only strings in its own table with all four languages. Never hard-code user-visible text.
